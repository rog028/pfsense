EndpointSec Software Installation Media
===================================

Overview
--------

The EndpointSec network firewall distribution, based on the
FreeBSD operating system with a custom kernel and including third party software packages for additional functionality. EndpointSec software, with the help
of the package system, is able to provide the same functionality or more of
common commercial firewalls, without any of the artificial limitations. It has
successfully replaced every big name commercial firewall you can imagine in
numerous installations around the world, including Check Point, Cisco PIX, Cisco
ASA, Juniper, Sonicwall, Netgear, Watchguard, Astaro, and more.

EndpointSec software includes a web interface for the configuration of all included
components. There is no need for any UNIX knowledge, no need to use the command
line for anything, and no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Users
familiar with commercial firewalls catch on to the web interface quickly, though
there can be a learning curve for users not familiar with commercial-grade
firewalls.
